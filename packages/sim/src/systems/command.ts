/**
 * CommandSystem — the ONLY way sim state mutates from the outside. It runs first each tick, drains
 * the per-sim {@link CommandQueue} (`ctx.commands`), and applies each command in enqueue order,
 * appending it to the append-only command log (the save / replay / lockstep record). Every other
 * system reacts to the world these commands shape; nothing outside this seam pokes the world.
 *
 * Why a system and not a method: routing all mutation through one serializable command type (a
 * discriminated union, exhaustively handled via {@link assertNever}) is what makes "a save is a
 * command log" and lockstep multiplayer possible — the same commands replayed on the same ticks from
 * the same seed reproduce byte-identical state. Determinism: the queue is a plain FIFO array, so
 * apply order is exactly enqueue order — no Map/Set iteration, no wall-clock, no RNG.
 *
 * The command variants:
 *  - `placeBuilding` — create a {@link Building} of the given type at (x,y) for a tribe, with a
 *    {@link Stockpile} seeded from the building type's `stock` slots (`initial` amounts). Emits
 *    `buildingPlaced`. Gated by the tribe's `jobEnablesHouse` tech-graph (see {@link buildingEnabled}):
 *    a house locked behind a not-yet-present job is skipped. (Construction/material delivery is a
 *    Phase-3 ConstructionSystem; for the slice a placed, enabled building is immediately `built`.)
 *  - `spawnSettler` — create a {@link Settler} of the given job at (x,y) for a tribe. Emits
 *    `settlerBorn`.
 *  - `spawnAnimalHerd` — place a **herd of an animal tribe** around (x,y): `maximumgroupsize`
 *    creatures scattered within the animal's `maximumdistancetobirthpoint`, each a {@link Settler} of
 *    that animal tribe carrying a {@link Health} pool from `hitpoints_adult` and — when the record sets
 *    `movespeed` — a {@link MoveSpeed} walking pace from it, with a leader designated when
 *    `searchforleader` (see {@link spawnAnimalHerd}). Emits one `settlerBorn` per spawned creature.
 *    Skipped for a non-animal tribe (no `animaltypes` record).
 *  - `placeBoat` — place a **boat hull** (a {@link Vehicle}) of a ship type at (x,y) for a tribe, carrying
 *    an empty {@link Stockpile} (the "boats as mobile stores" entity). Emits `boatPlaced`. Gated by the
 *    tribe's ship-unlock tech graph ({@link tribeShipsUnlocked}): a cart/catapult/unknown/not-yet-unlocked
 *    type is skipped (still logged), the same stance as a tech-gated `placeBuilding` (see {@link placeBoat}).
 *  - `placeResource` — create a standing {@link Resource} node (a tree / mined deposit / plucked node)
 *    of a good at (x,y) through the shared {@link createResourceNode} assembly — the runtime analogue of
 *    the scene-setup `place*` helpers, for a map/scenario editor or the debug spawn palette. Skipped
 *    (still logged) for a good with no resource footprint record (bad input).
 *  - `dropGood` — drop a loose good pile on the ground at (x,y) through the shared {@link dropOrStackGood}
 *    assembly (a bare {@link Stockpile} that draws as a per-fill heap and rests in place), STACKING onto an
 *    existing same-good pile on the tile up to `MAX_GROUND_STACK` so repeated one-unit clicks pile up. The
 *    "place this good on the ground" order behind the HUD goods tool + the admin spawn palette. Skipped
 *    (still logged) for an unknown good or a non-positive amount (bad input).
 *  - `setProduction` — point a workplace's production at a good (currently a no-op marker until the
 *    recipe-selection slice; recorded in the log so replay stays faithful).
 *  - `demolish` — destroy a building entity (ids are never recycled), **first unbinding every
 *    settler employed there** (see {@link unbindWorkersOf}) so a worker isn't left latched to a dead
 *    workplace — it returns to idle and the JobSystem re-employs it elsewhere next tick. Only an
 *    entity that actually IS a building is destroyed: a demolish aimed at anything else (a settler,
 *    a resource, a boat — a stale or hostile command) is skipped.
 *  - `moveUnit` / `setJob` / `attackUnit` / `setStance` — the PLAYER-order commands that steer an
 *    EXISTING owned settler (the RTS "go there" / "change profession" / "attack that one" / "set military
 *    mode"): `moveUnit` sets a `MoveGoal` + a `PlayerOrder` soft timed override, `setJob` swaps the
 *    `jobType` and re-idles the unit, `attackUnit` stamps an `AttackOrder` combat focus (chase + strike a
 *    target regardless of sight), `setStance` writes the unit's `Stance` military mode (auto-engage /
 *    defend / ignore / flee). All live in ./orders.ts ({@link moveUnit}/{@link setJob}/{@link attackUnit}/
 *    {@link setStance}) and skip a dead/non-settler/neutral (and, for attack, non-combatant) target (still logged).
 *  - `assignWorker` — bind an EXISTING owned settler to a SPECIFIC building as a worker (the
 *    player-directed twin of the JobSystem's auto-assignment): set its `jobType` to the building's open
 *    worker slot and stamp its `JobAssignment` binding, through the same per-building openness gate the
 *    JobSystem applies (see {@link assignWorker}). Skipped for a full/wrong-tribe/non-workplace target.
 *
 * A command that references an unknown type id or a dead entity is a recoverable boundary failure
 * (bad UI input / a stale command), not a programmer bug: it is skipped (the log still records it,
 * so replay is faithful) rather than throwing — one bad command must not abort the tick.

/**

 * the binding, resets the job) — order-independent, no chosen-entity pick, so iterating store order is
 * permitted (AGENTS.md: only a scan whose result depends on *which* entity wins needs the canonical
