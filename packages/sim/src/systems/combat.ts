/**
 * CombatSystem (the **targeting** half of the combat loop) — choose who each idle combatant swings
 * at and start the {@link CurrentAtomic} `attack` that lands the hit. This is the front half of the
 * targeting→attack→hit→death loop: it picks a target and resolves the net damage; the AtomicSystem's
 * `attack` effect drains the target's {@link Health} (the hit), and the CleanupSystem reaps a felled
 * combatant. Together with those two already-landed halves it closes the loop.
 *
 * A **combatant** is a {@link Settler} that carries a {@link Health} pool (a fighter — a non-combat
 * settler/the golden slice carries none, so it never fights and the hash stays untouched, the
 * separate-optional-component pattern of `JobAssignment`/`Age`). An **animal-tribe** combatant
 * ({@link isAnimalTribe} — a recorded `[tribetype]` with no tech graph) is left out of this drive: a
 * player-vs-player swing is only between civilizations; civ-vs-animal aggression is the separate,
 * data-driven (`animaltypes.ini`) model the next roadmap item adds. For each idle, living, non-animal
 * combatant (no `CurrentAtomic` running, not travelling, `hitpoints > 0`), in deterministic store order,
 * the system:
 *
 *  - finds the nearest **enemy** ({@link Health}-bearing settler of a *different, non-animal* tribe)
 *    within the attacker's weapon **range** (Manhattan cells), canonical entity-id tie-break;
 *  - resolves the **net damage** that hit deals — the attacker's weapon ({@link attackerWeapon},
 *    keyed by the attacker's tribe+job) versus the target's armor class (class 0 = unarmored today;
 *    settlers don't wear armor yet), the verbatim `weapontypes`×`armortypes` join {@link combatDamage}
 *    computes — and starts an `attack` atomic carrying that resolved damage.
 *
 * The attacker stays put and swings (combat is in-place at range — no walk-into-melee drive yet; an
 * out-of-range enemy is simply not a target this tick, the original's "advance on the enemy" is a
 * later movement slice). The attack atomic id is {@link ATTACK_ATOMIC_ID} (the original's
 * `setatomic <job> 81 "..._attack"`, bound per job to a weapon-specific animation — see
 * docs/FIDELITY.md); its `duration` is resolved through that binding like every other atomic.
 *
 * FIDELITY: the **net-damage amount** is the faithful `weapontypes`×`armortypes` param join (the same
 * pin as the `attack` effect / `combatDamage` read view); the **playable-vs-animal split** of who may
 * fight here is the faithful tech-graph signature ({@link isAnimalTribe} — only a civilization carries
 * `jobEnables`). **Approximated (no oracle):** *who* a settler picks (nearest enemy in range), the
 * *swing cadence* (re-target each idle tick), and that a settler with no resolvable weapon does no
 * damage are *our* deterministic combat design — the original's target-acquisition AI is the
 * undocumented "soul" (docs/FIDELITY.md). A settler also wears no armor yet, so every target resolves
 * as unarmored (class 0); armor-on-a-settler is a later slice.
 *
 * Determinism: no RNG, no wall-clock; combatants and targets are scanned in canonical
 * ({@link World.canonicalEntities}) order with a Manhattan-distance + ascending-id tie-break, and the
 * weapon/damage join is a pure read over content. No-ops without a terrain graph (a mapless sim has no
 * cells to measure range over — the golden is untouched). Inert on the goldens/slice: no settler there
 * carries `Health`, so the combatant scan finds nobody.
