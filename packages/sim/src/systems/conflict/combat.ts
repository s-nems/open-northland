/**
 * CombatSystem (the **targeting** half of the combat loop) — choose who each idle combatant swings
 * at and start the {@link CurrentAtomic} `attack` that lands the hit. This is the front half of the
 * targeting→attack→hit→death loop: it picks a target and resolves the net damage; the AtomicSystem's
 * `attack` effect drains the target's {@link Health} (the hit), and the CleanupSystem reaps a felled
 * combatant. Together with those two already-landed halves it closes the loop.
 *
 * A **combatant** is a {@link Settler} that carries a {@link Health} pool (a fighter — a non-combat
 * settler/the golden slice carries none, so it never fights and the hash stays untouched, the
 * separate-optional-component pattern of `JobAssignment`/`Age`). Two hostility models drive who an
 * idle combatant may swing at, unified in {@link mayAttack}:
 *
 *  - **Civilization vs civilization** — a different-civilization combatant is an enemy (the
 *    player-vs-player drive); a same-tribe settler is friendly; alliances are a later slice.
 *  - **Civilization ⇄ aggressive animal** — an **aggressive** animal ({@link isAggressiveAnimal} —
 *    `animaltypes.ini` `aggressive`, attacks unprovoked) and a civilization are mutual enemies, so a
 *    bear/wolf engages a nearby settler **and** that settler fights back. A `cannotbeattacked` animal
 *    (decorative fauna — bees) is exempt as a *target* (a civ can't hit it) but, if aggressive, can
 *    still attack. A **passive** animal (a cow, a deer) is no combat target — hostility leaves it alone.
 *  - **Hunter → catchable prey** — a civilization **hunter** ({@link mayHunt} — job
 *    {@link HUNTER_JOB}) may strike a {@link isCatchableAnimal} prey animal (a cow/deer the hostility
 *    relation leaves alone), the original's `viking_hunter_attack`. This is predation, gated by the
 *    attacker's *job* not tribe hostility; the strike reuses the same `attack` atomic + weapon/hit path,
 *    and (for a `getAngry` prey) is the **provocation source** the `Anger` timer waits on. Animals don't
 *    fight each other here.
 *
 * For each idle, living combatant (no `CurrentAtomic` running, not travelling, `hitpoints > 0`), in
 * deterministic store order, the system finds the nearest valid target within the attacker's weapon
 * **range** (Manhattan cells, canonical entity-id tie-break), resolves the **net damage** that hit
 * deals — the attacker's weapon ({@link attackerWeapon}, keyed by the attacker's tribe+job for a
 * settler, or by tribe alone for a jobless spawned animal) versus **the target's armor class** (its
 * {@link Armor} tier, or class 0 when it wears none — the verbatim `weapontypes`×`armortypes` join
 * {@link netDamageVs}/{@link combatDamage} computes) — and starts an `attack` atomic carrying that
 * resolved damage.
 *
 * The attacker stays put and swings (combat is in-place at range — no walk-into-melee drive yet; an
 * out-of-range enemy is simply not a target this tick, the original's "advance on the enemy" is a
 * later movement slice). The attack atomic id is {@link ATTACK_ATOMIC_ID} (the original's
 * `setatomic <job> 81 "..._attack"`, bound per job to a weapon-specific animation — see
 * docs/FIDELITY.md); its `duration` is resolved through that binding like every other atomic.
 *
 * FIDELITY: the **net-damage amount** is the faithful `weapontypes`×`armortypes` param join (the same
 * pin as the `attack` effect / `combatDamage` read view) — now resolved against the **target's worn
 * armor class** ({@link Armor}, the `damage[targetClass] - blockingValue` join), not a fixed unarmored
 * value; the **civ-vs-animal hostility gate** reads the faithful `aggressive`/`cannotbeattacked`
 * params, and the **playable-vs-animal split** is the faithful tech-graph signature
 * ({@link isAnimalTribe}). **Approximated (no oracle):** *who* a combatant picks (nearest enemy in
 * range), the *swing cadence* (re-target each idle tick), and that an unarmed combatant does no damage
 * are *our* deterministic design — the original's target-acquisition AI is the undocumented "soul"
 * (docs/FIDELITY.md). *Which* settler wears *which* armor class is caller-supplied (`spawnSettler`),
 * not yet pinned to a soldier-class→armor binding. The **provoked**-anger half (`getAngry`/
 * `angryGameTime` — a passive animal turned hostile after being struck) is **now wired**: the
 * AtomicSystem stamps an {@link Anger} timer on a struck `getAngry` animal, and this system reads it
 * ({@link hostileAnimalNow} on the attacker side, {@link mayTarget} on the target side) so a provoked
 * animal fights back and is a valid target until the timer lapses, then reverts to passive.
 *
 * Determinism: no RNG, no wall-clock; combatants and targets are scanned in canonical
 * ({@link World.canonicalEntities}) order with a Manhattan-distance + ascending-id tie-break, and the
 * weapon/damage/hostility joins are pure reads over content. No-ops without a terrain graph (a mapless
 * sim has no cells to measure range over — the golden is untouched). Inert on the goldens/slice: no
 * settler there carries `Health`, so the combatant scan finds nobody.

 * the per-class `weapontypes`×`armortypes` join, not a fixed unarmored value. Null when no weapon
 * resolves (an unarmed combatant — it does no damage, the approximated stance).
 *
 * **The reach is a band, not just a ceiling.** `maxRange` is the far reach (floored at 1, so even a
 * `maxRange 0` weapon still reaches an adjacent cell). `minRange` is the *near* reach a **ranged**
 * weapon can't fire below — the original's `hunter_bow` is `minimumrange 3, maximumrange 17` (verified
 * in the mod's `DataCnmd/types/weapons.ini`), so a bow can't hit an adjacent target; a melee weapon is
 * `minRange 1` (the common case — it hits from one cell away). Both ends are floored at 1, so a target
 * sharing the attacker's own cell (Manhattan distance 0) is below every weapon's near reach and is not
 * hit — only a real concern when the herd scatter stacks entities (entities share tiles freely). The
 * band is clamped sane (`1 ≤ minRange ≤ maxRange`) so a malformed weapon never reads as never-able-to-hit.
 *
 * Three resolution paths, mirroring how the original keys a weapon (the worn override takes precedence):
 *
 *  - **An explicitly-equipped combatant** (`wornWeaponTypeId` set — a settler carrying a {@link Weapon}) →
 *    the {@link WeaponType} matching its **own tribe + that `typeId`**, overriding the `(tribe, jobType)`
 *    default below. This is what lets one settler of a soldier-class hold a *specific* weapon from the
 *    several its class may wield (`weaponsForJob`); a worn id that resolves to no record leaves it unarmed
 *    for the tick (rather than silently falling back to the default), the "the data doesn't define it →
 *    it does nothing" stance {@link Armor} takes for an out-of-table class.
 *  - **A settler with a `jobType`** (a civilization soldier/hunter, or a bound combatant) → the
 *    {@link WeaponType} whose `tribeType` matches the attacker's tribe **and** whose `jobType` matches
 *    the attacker's job, exactly as the original binds a weapon to a *job*.
 *  - **A jobless animal** (`jobType === null` on a {@link isAnimalTribe} tribe — what `spawnAnimalHerd`
 *    places: an animal isn't born into a trade) → the tribe's weapon keyed by **`tribeType` alone**.
 *    An animal's combat identity IS its tribe (each animal tribe carries essentially one attack weapon
 *    — `claw`/`bearfist`/`wolvefist`, all at `typeId 1`); the weapon's `jobType` in the real data is the
 *    creature's monster combat-class, not a player-assignable trade, so a spawned animal can't match on
 *    job. Without this a spawned aggressive animal resolves no weapon and does no damage despite
 *    {@link mayAttack} engaging it.
 *
 * Determinism: a pure scan of `content.weapons` returning the FIRST match in source-array order (a
 * `(tribeType, jobType)` pair — and an animal tribe's weapon set — may have more than one row; source
 * order is the stable choice, the same determinism stance the extractor keeps and {@link combatDamage}
 * documents — no Map keyed on a non-unique identity). The worn-weapon path keys on `(tribe, typeId)`,
 * which can still recur across animal weapons, so it too takes the first source-order match.
