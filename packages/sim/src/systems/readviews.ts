 * with any real job id; every other entry's key is a real `JobType.typeId`.
 *
 * The **age-classes-vs-trades** split the HUD wants is a property of the *keys*, not of this view:
 * keys 1–4 are the non-working baby/child stages (`isNonWorkingAge` in `systems/ageclass.ts`), key 5
 * (`woman`) and up are adult roles, and `null`/{@link IDLE_JOB} is an unassigned adult — so a panel
 * partitions the returned map by classifying each key, exactly as the source models life-stage as a
 * `jobType`. This view does not pre-split, to stay a single faithful "settlers by job" tally that
 * any grouping can read.

 * order-independent (addition commutes, so the Settler-store traversal order can't change a tally), so
 * the values are identical run-to-run. The returned Map's *iteration* order is insertion order
