/**
 * The WORLD METRIC of the staggered-raster lattice — the sim-side twin of the measured projection
 * (docs/FIDELITY.md "projection"; the render half lives in `render`'s `iso.ts`).
 *
 * The original's map is NOT a square grid: cells sit on a STAGGERED raster (odd rows shifted half a
 * cell right), with the measured pitch **68 px per column step × 38 px per row step**. Distances the
 * sim reasons about for MOVEMENT (how long a step is, hence how fast a walk covers it on screen) must
 * use that geometry, not naive grid units — a grid-space metric makes a north–south walk read ~25%
 * slower than an east–west one and prices the lattice's edges wrongly for the pathfinder (the old
 * octile costs were the root of the zigzag routes; docs/FIDELITY.md "Movement on the staggered
 * lattice").
 *
 * Everything here is expressed in COLUMN UNITS: one full cell width (a column step, 68 px) = ONE.
 * A row step is then 38/68 = 19/34 of a unit down and exactly half a unit sideways (the stagger), so
 * the four row-crossing lattice edges have length √(½² + (19/34)²) ≈ **0.75·ONE — the measured pitch
 * makes a diagonal edge almost exactly ¾ of a horizontal one** (51 px vs 68 px), which is why these
 * constants divide so cleanly. Pure fixed-point (the sanctioned isqrt), no floats — the metric feeds
 * game state, so it must be byte-deterministic.
