 * and never enters a gatherer's harvest scans.
 *
 * source-basis: the original's `landscapetypes.ini` bush cycle — `bush with fruits` (type 11) on the PICK
 * trigger (`transition 3 <bush naked> 2 0 18`) yields good 18 `fruit` and becomes `bush naked` (type 9),
 * which regrows `naked → flowering (10) → with fruits (11)` on the periodic GROWTH trigger (`transition 7 …`).
 * The single `transition 3` sends `with fruits` straight to `naked`, so a bush holds exactly one serving.
 *
 * Named divergence: that pick transition produces good 18 `fruit` into the economy, but good 18 has no
 * extracted `gatheringPipeline`, so this model discards the good and feeds the eater directly — wild grazing,
 * not a gather-a-good step. The regrow duration and the two-step flowering stage are likewise approximated:
 * the trigger-7 period is not decoded, so this collapses naked→flowering→fruits into one ripe/bare state
 * timed by `ripeAtTick` (see systems/economy/berries.ts).
 *
 * `ripe` is whether the bush currently holds fruit. `ripeAtTick` is the absolute tick the BerryGrowthSystem
 * flips a bare bush back to ripe; unused (0) while ripe. `gfxIndex` is the render-variant tag (see
