 * A wild berry bush - a natural food source anyone can graze, distinct from the job-gated {@link Resource}

 * needed, and the bush regrows over time. Deliberately not a {@link Resource}: it carries no harvest atomic
 * and never enters a gatherer's harvest scans.
 *
 * source-basis: the original's `landscapetypes.ini` bush cycle - `bush with fruits` (type 11) on the PICK
 * trigger (`transition 3 <bush naked> 2 0 18`) yields good 18 `fruit` and becomes `bush naked` (type 9),
 * which regrows `naked → flowering (10) → with fruits (11)` on the periodic GROWTH trigger (`transition 7 …`).
 * The single `transition 3` sends `with fruits` straight to `naked`, so a bush holds exactly one serving.
 *
 * The regrow is modelled as those three discrete `stage`s (`bare` = naked, `flowering`, `ripe` = with
 * fruits) so the two source growth steps read on the map: a foraged bush is `bare`, blooms `flowering` at
 * the midpoint of its regrow, then holds fruit again. Only a `ripe` bush is forageable.
 *
 * Named divergence: the pick transition produces good 18 `fruit` into the economy, but good 18 has no
 * extracted `gatheringPipeline`, so this model discards the good and feeds the eater directly - wild grazing,
 * not a gather-a-good step. The regrow duration is approximated (the trigger-7 period is not decoded - see
 * systems/economy/berries.ts); the two growth steps are equal halves, so `flowering` lands at exactly half.
 *
 * `stage` is the bush's current growth state. `nextStageAtTick` is the absolute tick the BerryGrowthSystem
 * advances a regrowing bush to its next stage (absolute, not a countdown: an exact integer compare, so the
 * snapshot scenery cache re-clones a bush only at its three transitions per cycle); unused (0) while `ripe`.
 * `gfxIndex` is the render-variant tag (see {@link Resource.gfxIndex}).
