 * The atomic micro-action a settler is currently executing (the unit of behavior in Cultures, e.g.

 * advances `progress` from 0 to ONE over `duration` ticks, and on completion applies the typed
 * {@link AtomicEffect} (the state mutation), emits an `atomicCompleted` event, and removes the
 * component — the planner sees an entity with no CurrentAtomic as ready for its next atomic.
 *
 * `atomicId` keeps the numeric content cross-reference (fidelity / the join key onto a tribe's
 * `setatomic` animation); `effect` is the typed action the executor applies, so the apply switch is
 * exhaustive and golden traces are human-readable rather than opaque ints. `duration` is the
 * animation length in ticks (`AtomicAnimation.length`, supplied by the planner) — at least 1, so a
 * zero-length animation still completes in exactly one tick. `targetEntity`/`targetTile` are the
 * action's object (the resource to harvest, the store to pile up at).
 *
 * Timing is driven by the INTEGER `elapsed` tick counter, not by accumulating a fixed-point step:
 * `ONE / duration` truncates (e.g. ONE/3), so a fractional step summed `duration` times would never
 * reach ONE and the atomic would hang. Completion is the exact `elapsed >= duration`; `progress`
 * (0..ONE) is a derived display value for render interpolation, never the completion test.
