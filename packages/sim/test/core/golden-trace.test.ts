/**
 * GOLDEN STATE-HASH + GOLDEN ATOMIC-ACTION TRACE — the determinism tripwire.
 *
 * The lower-level golden tests pin one mechanic each over tens of ticks; this is the *integration*
 * golden. It drives the **whole vertical slice** end-to-end for ~1000 ticks through the real
 * `Simulation.step()` schedule (CommandSystem → AI planner → pathfinding → movement → atomic executor
 * → production → carrier) and pins two complementary fingerprints of the run:
 *
 *  - the final canonical **state hash** (`hashState()`) — every component on every entity; one bit of
 *    drift anywhere changes it. This catches *that* something changed.
 *  - the **atomic-action trace** — the ordered list of `atomicCompleted` events as
 *    `"tick:entity:atomicId"`, collected every tick. The hash says state diverged; the trace says
 *    *which behavior* diverged and *when*, in human-readable terms. This is the agent's self-check
 *    that the settler economy still does the same thing tick-for-tick. The atomic ids are the
 *    fixture's vocabulary: 24 = harvest (the woodcutter), 23 = pileup (deposit at a store), 22 =
 *    pickup (the carrier hauling planks out of the workplace).
 *
 * Invariants run **after every tick** (not just at the end), so a system that transiently breaks the
 * world (negative stock, hunger out of range) is caught at the exact tick it happens, not masked by a
 * later recovery. If any golden below moves, it must be an *intentional* mechanic change — name it in
 * the commit (see packages/sim/AGENTS.md "the golden rule of the goldens").
 *
 * Scenario (a self-supplying woodcutter + a self-servicing carpenter + a carrier — the slice's exit goal):
 *   - a 6×1 grass strip;
 *   - a HEADQUARTERS store (x=5, starting with 10 wood) and a SAWMILL workplace (x=4), both placed via
 *     the COMMAND log (exercising CommandSystem) so the run also pins the placement seam;
 *   - a WOODCUTTER and a CARRIER spawned via commands, plus a CARPENTER spawned **on** the sawmill
 *     (x=4) as its operator — the SAWMILL's `workers` slot names the carpenter job, and the production
 *     worker-presence gate only runs the mill while that operator is present;
 *   - two finite FELLABLE wood nodes (placed directly — no map/resource command yet), each felled over
 *     3 chops and dropping a 4-wood trunk (the wood good's `gathering` felling spec).
 * The whole goods chain runs end to end and conserves goods: the woodcutter FELLS each tree (3 chops
 * yielding nothing → the tree drops a ground trunk holding its whole 4 wood) and banks the felled wood
 * at its own work flag → the CARRIER — posted to the HQ's transport slot on tick 1 by the JobSystem's
 * report-in pass (hauling is worked only through an assignment) — ferries the flag-banked wood into
 * the HQ and hauls finished planks there too → the carpenter runs its own supply→produce→deliver
 * loop, fetching the HQ's wood into the mill (the input-supply drive) and hauling planks back out.
 * 2 stumps are left where the trees stood; goods are conserved throughout, invariant-clean for the
 * whole 1000-tick tail (10 stored + 8 felled wood; the produced count is pinned below).
