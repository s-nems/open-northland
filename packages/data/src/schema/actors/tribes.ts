 * `job`→{@link JobType}, `vehicle`→{@link VehicleType} via its `type`/`logicvehicletype` namespace,
 * which is distinct from the building namespace).
 *
 * This is the gate half of the progression graph — the original keys availability of goods/houses/
 * jobs/vehicles on a job being present, which is in turn gated by training/experience (`trainforjob`/
 * `needfor*`, a later slice). Edges are kept in exact source file order (the data interleaves the
 * four kinds within a job's block, not grouped by kind); a tribe may repeat a `(jobType, kind,
 * targetId)` triple, kept verbatim like {@link AtomicBinding} (the raw source stays faithful).

 * - `target`: `job` (`*forjob` — the unlocked job id) vs `good` (`*forgood` — the unlocked good id).
 *
 * `experienceTypes` mostly name `humanjobexperiencetypes` `typeId`s, but they span an id space
 * wider than that 70-entry table — `need` lines reach 72/73/75 and `train` lines pay in synthetic
 * "school" markers (observed 57/77) — none of which are in the experience table. So they are captured
 * but deliberately not cross-validated (validating them would false-positive — unlike the `vehicle`
 * {@link JobEnables} kind, which does resolve now the `vehicletypes` table is extracted). A line
 * carries one or two expTypes (the optional second is rare); kept in source order.
