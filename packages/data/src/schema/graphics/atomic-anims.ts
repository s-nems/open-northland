 * `[bobseq]` it plays and the explicit per-direction frame-index lists that lay that
 * animation out across the 8 facings. Render-binding data (like {@link BobSequenceSet}); the pure sim
 * ignores it.
 *
 * This is the directional layout a {@link BobSequence}'s bare `start`/`length` cannot encode. Each
 * `gfxanimframelistdir <dir> <idx…>` line gives one facing its own ordered list of local frame indices
 * into the bodySeq pool (global bob id = `bodySeq.start + idx`), carrying authored holds/repeats inline
 * (a spear windup repeats its first frame five times, `[79,79,79,79,79,80,…]`) and reuse (mirror
 * directions share frames). A melee swing pool is not even divisible by 8 (`Sword_Attack` 102,
 * `spear_attack` 108), so a `start + facing*stride` slice is meaningless.
