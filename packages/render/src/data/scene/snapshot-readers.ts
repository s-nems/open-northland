 * Stockpile at all, so it always reads `{}`). The snapshot clones a `Stockpile.amounts` Map to an ascending-by-goodType
 * `[goodType, amount]` array (see `inspect/snapshot.ts`), so this reads that plain shape. The pile's good
 * is the one it holds MOST of (strict `>` keeps the FIRST max — i.e. the lowest goodType on a tie,
 * *because* the snapshot pre-sorts `amounts` ascending by goodType). That canonical order is what makes
 * the pick reproducible across runs. A pile in the gathering economy holds a single good, so this is
 * unambiguous there; the max rule just keeps a mixed heap deterministic.
