 * deposits' `MineDeposit`/`Resource` from THESE constants, so the mining pace can't drift between scenes
 * (the recurring per-scene-magic-number complaint). Add a new mined good's calibration here, not in the
 * scene. Mirrors {@link import('./felling.js')} for the felling half of the gathering pipeline.
 *
 * The deposit SIZE is genuinely OBSERVED (source basis "Mineral deposits"): the readable data has no
 * field established to be the harvestable-unit count — `landscapetypes.ini` `maximumValency` is a per-cell
 * valency (constant across a good's stages, e.g. mud_mine = mud_ore = mud = 6), not the count. So these
 * sizes are demonstrative, pending calibration against the original; the pipeline emits `0` (not a deposit)
 * until observed. The level COUNT below is DIFFERENT — it is gfx DATA, not observed.
