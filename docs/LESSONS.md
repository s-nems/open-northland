# Lessons — the loop's hard-won memory

One-line, **commit-grounded** gotchas that a fresh-context iteration would otherwise re-learn. This
is the compounding half of the work loop: when a step surfaces a non-obvious, generalizable trap
(a determinism pitfall, a "green tests but broke at the real entry point" slip), it lands here so
the next iteration inherits it.

**Scope.** This file is *not* rules (those graduate to [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) /
[`packages/sim/CLAUDE.md`](../packages/sim/CLAUDE.md)), *not* the plan
([`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)), and *not* deferred reworks ([`TECH-DEBT.md`](TECH-DEBT.md)).

**Contract.**
- Format: `- [<sha>] <lesson> — <fix/why> (<area>)`. Ground every entry in the commit that taught it.
- Keep it lean: most steps add nothing. Add a line only when re-learning it would cost real time.
- Curation (a `/reflect` duty): promote a recurring / rule-worthy lesson into `CLAUDE.md` and prune
  it here; drop entries the code has made obsolete. This is the anti-bloat valve.

## Lessons

- [fec4ded] Integer atomic durations: `progress = ONE/duration` truncates, so an odd duration never
  reaches `ONE` and the atomic hangs forever — count an integer `elapsed` to the exact
  `elapsed >= duration`; keep `progress` only as a derived display value. (sim/atomic)
- [6a4d20a] Path completion removes `PathFollow` in pass 1, so a `Velocity`-bearing entity
  double-moves on its arrival tick unless pass 2 skips path-handled ids — record handled ids in a
  membership Set and skip them. (sim/movement)
- [ca10cf4] raw-TS strip-types can't resolve the sim's `.js` import specifiers, so the test fixture
  isn't in `dist/` — hands-on sim smoke runs go through a throwaway `vitest` spec on the real
  `Simulation.step()` schedule, not compiled `dist/`. (tooling)
- [bfe2491] A weapon `type` id isn't globally unique (105 weapons collapse to 19 typeIds — per-tribe
  re-use), so `indexById` silently drops records; key by `(tribeType, typeId)`. (data/extract)
- [9a497c9] `npm run build` (tsc) only compiles `src/**` — test files aren't in the project graph and
  vitest doesn't typecheck, so adding a required `SystemContext` field leaves stale test `ctx` literals
  type-broken yet green; grep `SystemContext = {` across `test/` when the context shape changes. (sim/tooling)
- [4ef956f] A roadmap "extract X from file Y" promise can name a field that file Y doesn't have —
  `landscapetypes.ini` has no per-type movement weight (only `maximumValency` + placement flags), so
  the long-carried "real per-type walk-cost field, pending extraction" was chasing a non-existent
  source. Before implementing a "pending extraction" step, grep the actual source file's key set
  first; correct the roadmap when the field isn't there rather than inventing a mapping. (data/roadmap)
- [79e02a7] Importing a `test/` file (e.g. a fixture) from production `src/` drags it into that
  package's `tsc --build` graph, which emits `.js`/`.d.ts` *in-place next to the .ts* — stray
  untracked artifacts `biome check` then lints and fails on. Keep dev/demo fixtures self-contained in
  `src/` (a tiny synthetic copy), don't reach across into another package's `test/`. (tooling/render)
- [94bae6d] A speculative/dead named-import added when extracting helpers into a new module slips
  past BOTH gates: biome's `recommended` set doesn't error on `noUnusedImports`, and `tsc`'s
  `noUnusedLocals` won't flag one *member* of a still-partly-used import group (`{ Building, Stockpile }`
  where only `Building` is used). Eyeball the new file's imports against its body after a module split —
  green build + green check don't prove every import is live. (sim/tooling)
- [76dfbf1] A long-open "binary format not located" risk can be a *wrong-file* assumption: the map
  tile grid was never in `map.cif` (only the logic-header `CStringArray`, 0 trailing bytes) — it's the
  sibling `map.dat`. Probe the whole asset *directory*, not just the named file; and check the
  OpenVikings oracle's IO/container helpers (`CIoHelper.cs` `SIoHelperChunk`) even though it "doesn't
  simulate" — it still pins the on-disk container layout. (pipeline/format)
- [fa70452] A `sim` mechanic with data-pinned *parameters* (atomic durations, job gates, stock caps)
  is NOT thereby `faithful` — its *behavior* (planner/loop shape) has no oracle (OpenVikings' tick is
  a stub). Classify those rows `approximated` with "calibration-by-observation pending"; reserve
  `faithful` for when both axes are pinned. Over-claiming faithful is the blind spot FIDELITY.md
  exists to catch. (docs/fidelity)
- [cfc2431] A binary format's "size" field can mean *different* things at adjacent offsets: the
  map.dat packed-layer header carries `innerSize` (the whole inner blob, +0x01 and again +0x11) AND
  a separate `unpackedLength` (+0x0D, the decoded byte count) — using the inner size as the stream
  length over-runs by exactly the header overhead. Drive the RLE loop by `unpackedLength` and let the
  stream end at the payload boundary; cross-check the decoded length is an exact multiple of `cells`.
  When porting a format the oracle doesn't cover, probe ≥3 real files of different sizes before trusting
  a field's meaning. (pipeline/format)
- [cfc2431] A "decode trusts the bytes" RLE/copy loop silently mis-decodes corrupt input: `Uint8Array.fill`
  clamps an over-long end (no throw), `subarray(i,i+b)` clamps a past-end read, and `out.set` then
  writes fewer bytes than the control advanced `o`/`i` by — so a truncated layer yields a zero-padded
  grid instead of the promised throw. Bounds-check both the source read (`i+b<=len`) and the dest write
  (`o+count<=unpacked`) explicitly per control byte if the decoder's contract says "throws on corrupt".
  (pipeline/format)
- [4b01c26] A decoded layer can carry MORE structure than the consumer wants: `map.dat` `lmlt` is the
  landscape-type grid but 4 B/cell (one typeId per triangle CORNER), while the nav cell-graph wants ONE
  typeId per cell. Confirm the lane by probing real maps (values 0..85 within the 87-type IR table,
  ~64% uniform cells), then pick a deterministic reduction (dominant corner, lowest-typeId tie-break)
  and classify it `approximated` in FIDELITY — the corner→cell rule has no behavioral oracle (OpenVikings
  decodes the container but doesn't simulate nav). Keep the reduction in the build tool, returning the
  plain `{width,height,typeIds}` shape, so it never imports `sim`. (pipeline/format)
- [5344d5d] A binary index lane and the IR table it keys into can use different bases: the `map.dat`
  `lmlt` layer is **0-based** (raw 0 = first type, "void") but `LandscapeType.typeId` mirrors the
  1-based `.ini` `type` field, so a grid built straight from the raw indices made the sim's
  `buildTerrainGraph` reject raw `0` as "absent from content". The decoder unit tests were green —
  the off-by-one only surfaced on the *real* `npm run pipeline` + loading an emitted grid through the
  real builder (the synthetic test grids happened to avoid typeId 0). When wiring a decoder's output
  into a consumer that *validates* against another table, run the consumer over the real output, not
  just the unit fixture; the earlier "values 0..85 within the 87-type table" note ([4b01c26]) was the
  0-based tell read as if 1-based. (pipeline/format)
- [7a95187] A `Uint16Array` view over a freshly-decoded byte buffer reads **host-endian**, not the
  file's byte order — and a pack→unpack round-trip test can't catch it (pack + unpack share the host's
  endianness, so the bug is invisible on the only realistic LE target). Compose multi-byte elements
  **explicitly LE** (`lo | hi<<8`), matching the file's existing `DataView(..., true)` reads, and pin
  it with a test that decodes a *hand-built LE stream* (not a round-trip) so an endianness regression
  fails even on a little-endian host. (pipeline/format)
- [690a547] vitest resolves a cross-package import (`@vinland/data`) through that package's BUILT
  `dist/` entry, not its `src/`, so a brand-new export is `… is not a function` in another package's
  test until you `npm run build` — green-looking source, runtime-missing symbol. After adding an export
  consumed by a *different* package's test, rebuild before `npm test` (or the failure looks like a typo,
  not a stale build). (tooling)
- [11cde56] The browser app can't read the gitignored repo-root `content/` directly (it's outside the
  vite root, and `fetch` needs an HTTP path). Bridge it with a **vite dev-server middleware**
  (`configureServer` → `server.middlewares.use('/maps', …)`) that serves the out-of-root files — but
  note vite **strips the mount prefix**, so `req.url` inside the handler is the path *after* `/maps`
  (e.g. `/oasis.json`, not `/maps/oasis.json`). Guard traversal at two layers (a `^[a-z0-9_-]+$` id
  regex on the fetch side + a resolved-path `startsWith(root + sep)` check in the middleware), and keep
  the consumer's load path **fallback-on-failure** so a checkout WITHOUT the gitignored content still
  runs. This is dev/shot-server only — a production `vite build` won't serve it. (app/render)
- [ac6a287] Component stores are module-level singletons SHARED by every `Simulation`/`World` instance
  (`defineComponent` makes one `Map`; `new World()` resets the id counter but NOT the stores). So a
  test that builds two sims in one process without clearing leaks the first run's entities into the
  second, and because `world.query` iterates **store insertion order**, the second sim's planner then
  acts on stale entities → non-deterministic. `hashState()` does NOT catch it: it hashes
  `canonicalEntities()` (sorted), so two runs can hash-equal mid-tick yet diverge once a query-order
  decision fires. Clear every component's store between runs (`for (v of Object.values(components)) if
  (v.store instanceof Map) v.store.clear()` — filter, the namespace also re-exports helpers), exactly
  as `golden-trace.test.ts` does in `beforeEach`. Surfaced only on a multi-ROW map (the 1-D 6×1 strip
  never exercised a query-order-dependent target choice). (sim/test)
- [12db5fa] An un-self-judgeable render step (pixels need a human) still has a self-verifiable HALF: the
  *data decision*. The atlas-sprite swap splits into "which atlas frame does this DrawItem draw"
  (`resolveSpriteFrame` — a pure lookup, fully unit-testable: bound→frame, tile/unbound/missing/0×0→null)
  and "bind that rect to a GPU texture + sample its pixels" (the human-judged half). Build + test the
  data half NOW, gate the pixel half on the human/asset, and keep the GPU input OPTIONAL (a `SpriteSheet?`
  defaulting to the placeholder path) so the reproducible `npm run shot` default is byte-unchanged.
  Generalises: when a step is "blocked on a human/asset", carve off the pure decision and land that. (render)
- [51eb0d4] When a render binding can be EITHER a scalar or a per-state table (`number |
  SettlerStateBinding`), drive the atlas tests through the public `resolveSpriteFrame(item, …)` seam, not
  by indexing `bindings[kind]` as a bob id directly — the moment `settler` became a table, every test
  that did `atlas.frames.get(SYNTHETIC_BINDINGS[k])` broke, and resolving via the public lookup also
  caught a real frame-overlap (new settler frames collided with the building rect) + a sheet-bounds
  overrun the bounds assertion then flagged (had to grow `SYNTHETIC_ATLAS_HEIGHT`). A no-overlap test
  that enumerates *resolved* frames (all states) is the one that catches a layout collision; one keyed
  off raw ids silently skips the new frames. (render/test)
- [400e8a9] To EXERCISE (not just unit-test) a render branch that's blocked on a copyrighted asset, a
  FREE SYNTHETIC stand-in unblocks it: a tiny hand-authored atlas (flat-colour marker frames drawn into
  a `CanvasSource`) binds through the exact same `SpriteSheet` shape a real bob atlas will, so the
  textured branch runs + is human-eyeballable today and the real art drops in later with no renderer
  change. Gate it behind an OPT-IN flag (`?atlas`, `--atlas`) so the byte-reproducible default
  (`npm run shot`) is untouched — and forward the flag through the harness script too (`shot.mjs`), or
  the "real entry point" can't reach the new path even though the app code supports it. (render/app)
- [a9dd864] An `.ini` line is one of two shapes — a *repeated single-value* key (`allowatomic N`,
  many lines) or a *single multi-value* line (`productionInputGoods 5 6 6`, one line, all tokens on it).
  The existing `getIntList` helper only reads `values[0]` of each matching property, so it silently
  drops every token but the first of a multi-value line (it was built for the repeated-key shape). For a
  multi-value line use a helper that reads ALL of `findProp(...).values`; eyeball the real source's
  grammar for the key before reusing a list helper, the names don't tell you which shape it is. The mod
  often has no readable twin for a base table (`goodtypes` ships only as base `Data/logic/*.ini`), so
  golden-rule-#4 "prefer the mod `.ini`" can fall through to the base `.ini` — that's still readable, not
  the encrypted `.cif`. (pipeline/format)
- [309e600] A data param that *varies along a dimension absent at the extraction layer* (production
  cycle `ticks` is per-tribe — viking coiner=200, frank coiner=60 — but the building-type table has no
  tribe) can still be pinned to a REAL source instead of a magic constant: pick a deterministic
  reference along that dimension (lowest-`typeId` tribe), resolve the actual value (worker `jobType` +
  good's `atomicForProduction` → that tribe's `setatomic` → `atomicanimations.length`), and record the
  collapsed dimension as a Deviation in FIDELITY.md. Strictly more faithful than a placeholder — and the
  per-dimension table stays a clean deferred refinement. Watch the produce-atomic join's fallbacks: a
  raw-good producer has no `atomicForProduction`, so guard each link and fall back per-building. (pipeline/fidelity)
- [20282ef] A worker-presence production gate moves the integration golden's state HASH but not its
  atomic TRACE: staffing the sawmill adds a new operator entity (the canonical full-state hash hashes
  every component on every entity, so a new entity shifts it), yet the behavioral atomic-trace +
  produced count are unchanged. That split is the right read of an intentional golden move — re-baseline
  the hash, but if the trace also moves, a real *behavior* changed and you must look harder. Keep the
  worker pinned without the full JobSystem by a narrow "a settler standing on a workplace it staffs is
  left put" planner rule (gated on the building having a RECIPE, so a store/HQ listing the same job
  doesn't freeze a harvester). (sim/goldens)
- [18243f3] A source's category flags can be INDEPENDENT booleans, not a mutually-exclusive enum: a
  `[goodtype]` sets `isProducedOnMapFlag`/`isProducedInHouseFlag`/`isInputGoodFlag` separately and the
  real data sets several at once (`leather` carries all three — gathered AND house-produced AND an
  input). Modelling such "raw vs produced vs input" layering as one enum would have to invent a
  precedence the source doesn't have; extract each flag as its own boolean and let a good occupy
  several layers. Confirm by grepping a record you expect to be "obviously one category" — the
  exception is the tell. (pipeline/format)
- [2cf9301] A behavior with no sim-oracle can still pin its *atomic id* from the original `tribetypes`
  `setatomic <job> <atomicId> "<animation>"` table even when nothing else about the behavior is
  pinned: grepping the real `tribetypes.ini` for the activity name (`eat_slot_food` → `setatomic 5 10`)
  reveals the canonical atomic id (eat=10, candy=11) for free, splitting a planner mechanic into a
  faithful id + animation-`length` join and an approximated trigger/target. Before inventing a magic
  atomic-id constant, grep `tribetypes` for the action name — the slot id is sitting right there. And
  put the eat-drive ABOVE the workplace-staffing pin in the planner, or a starving operator never
  leaves to feed. (sim/fidelity)
- [e13314d] A **target-bound** need (the settler must reach a SITE to satisfy it, unlike eat-at-a-store
  / sleep-in-place) needs a need→satisfier→**building** lookup — and the satisfier building is often
  identified by a *structural signature*, not a readable flag: the original "work temple" (logictype 37,
  logicmaintype 3) carries no `logicworker`/`logicstock`/`logicproduction`, so it surfaces as a
  `workplace` kind with no recipe/workers/stock — exactly the "infer the binding that lives below the
  readable data" pattern `isFood` uses (the `food_` id prefix). Don't invent a content flag the data
  lacks; recognise the building by what it conspicuously *omits*. And the new walk-to-target reuses the
  existing MoveGoal→PathRequest→PathFollow chain for free — the drive only sets the goal. (sim/fidelity)
- [3826bab] The temple structural-signature trick does NOT generalize to every target-bound need — it
  worked for `pray` only because the temple is (nearly) the unique no-recipe/no-worker/no-stock house.
  `enjoy` (id 17) has no readable building satisfier: the only houses with that signature are `work
  temple` (lt 37) and `work murek` (a decorative wall, lt 55), so structural inference can't name a
  leisure site. Verify the satisfier is actually distinguishable in `houses.ini` BEFORE planning a
  drive — don't assume the previous need's approach ports. When it can't be pinned, ship the rise+reset
  half (both pinned to data) and defer the drive in FIDELITY rather than inventing a satisfier. (sim/fidelity)

- [8302ea7] A named atomic isn't necessarily a new NEED — it may be a second SATISFIER of an existing
  one. `make_love` (id 78) reads like a distinct social need, but its animation restores the **same
  channel 3** as `enjoy` (`event <at> 3 +800` vs enjoy's `+100`), i.e. the leisure/`enjoyment` bar — so
  it resets the existing field, no new component. Before adding a need field for a satisfier atomic,
  read the animation's `event <at> <channel> <delta>` tuples and check which channel it restores; the
  bar count is set by the distinct channels, not by the atomic count. (sim/fidelity)
- [97d6755] A roadmap item's logic doesn't always belong in the system named after it. The
  ProgressionSystem's XP-accrual is **event-shaped** (it fires at the instant a work atomic completes),
  but sim events are render-only (must not be read back in sim logic), so a poll-driven `System` can't
  see the completion. The grant lives in the AtomicSystem's effect-apply (where the completion is
  known), exactly like the hunger/fatigue resets; the `progressionSystem` stub stays for the *gating*
  half. Before graduating a stub system, ask whether its logic is poll-shaped or event-shaped — the
  latter belongs at the event source. (sim/architecture)
- [2b407e0] When unifying several repeated `.ini` keys into one list IR, don't iterate key-by-key
  (`findProps(a)` then `findProps(b)`…) — that regroups the records by key and silently loses the
  source's interleaving. The `tribetypes` `jobEnables{Good,House,Job,Vehicle}` lines interleave the
  four kinds within a job's block; a single `sec.props` pass keyed on a kind-lookup keeps verbatim
  file order. Check the real source's ordering before choosing grouped vs single-pass extraction. (pipeline/fidelity)
- [dc1bb9b] A boolean "does ANY entity match?" query is order-independent, so it may iterate
  `world.query(...)` (insertion order) directly — it's a membership test like `Map.has`, which the
  determinism contract permits. Only a query whose RESULT depends on *which* match wins (a pick / a
  sum-with-order / a first-found mutation) needs `canonicalEntities()` + a sort. The `jobEnables`
  placement gate (`buildingEnabled`) returns true on the first enabling-job settler found and never
  cares which one — so a sorted scan would be dead cost. Ask "does the output change if matches are
  reordered?" before reaching for the canonical sort. (sim/determinism)
- [f6619a4] The mod's own `tribetypes - info.txt` doc can be wrong: it says `trainfor*`'s school
  expType is "always 77", but the real data also uses 57 (30/270 train lines), and it implies the
  `needfor*` expType is a `humanjobexperiencetypes` id (1..70) when need-ids actually reach 72/73/75.
  Extract the OBSERVED value, not the documented constant, and `grep` the real key set's value range
  before deciding what to cross-validate — an id that overshoots the resolvable table is the tell
  that a field is a wider/synthetic id space and must NOT be range-checked (false-positives). (pipeline/fidelity)
- [75b4e9c] Component stores are module-level singletons shared across every `Simulation` instance, so a
  multi-run hands-on smoke SCRIPT (not via the test harness, which clears them in `beforeEach`) leaks
  entities between runs — my "cross-tribe unlock" false alarm was run B's settler bleeding into run C.
  Clear the stores (or use one sim per process) between smoke runs; a direct helper call confirmed the
  gate itself was correct. (sim/verification)
- [c587b2b] When a *threshold-reader* consumes state a *writer* accrued, the fidelity win is that they
  key on the **same** id space with no translation layer: the `needfor*` `experienceTypes` reference the
  exact `humanjobexperiencetypes` track typeIds `grantWorkExperience` writes onto `Settler.experience`,
  so `experienceRequirementMet` joins the accrual half for free. But the reader must NOT cross-validate
  those ids — 23/26 real `need` expTypes resolve to a track, the other 3 (72/73/75) live in the wider
  id space the extractor already leaves unchecked ([f6619a4]) — so the read-side helper consumes the raw
  id and `.get()` simply returns 0 for an unmatched track (vacuously unmet), never throwing. Verify the
  join hands-on against the REAL IR (the keyspace overlap + the boundary gate), not just the fixture.
  (sim/progression)
- [8a0e4d6] An XP-`need` gate must be wired where the gated agent can ALSO satisfy it, or it deadlocks:
  reading `needforgood` as "the workplace OPERATOR's XP" looked obvious, but the operator (a carpenter)
  accrues no XP under the current sim (production grants none — `grantWorkExperience` fires only on
  harvest), so any non-zero threshold would lock that output forever. The faithful, non-deadlocking seam
  is the HARVEST planner (`nearestHarvestableFor`), where the gated settler IS the one who trains the
  good's track by doing the work the threshold guards. Before consuming a "you need XP in track T to do
  X" gate, check the sim actually grants track-T XP *to the agent X gates* — a gate whose input no agent
  can produce yet is a deadlock, not a faithful constraint; defer it to where the accrual loop closes.
  (sim/progression)
- [6264132] A new entity-assigning system stays deterministic AND self-balancing for free if it (a)
  iterates `canonicalEntities()` and takes the first match (a *pick*, so it must be canonical, unlike a
  boolean membership scan) and (b) re-derives the capacity count LIVE per candidate from world state
  rather than snapshotting it once: `jobSystem` assigns idle settlers in ascending-id order, and its
  `jobUnderstaffed` re-counts tribe-wide head-count each iteration, so assigning settler A bumps the
  count B sees — a 3-slot workplace fills with exactly 3, no shared mutable counter. A `query(Settler)`
  count is itself order-independent (addition commutes), so it needn't be canonical — only the *picking*
  loop does. The new system was provably inert in the golden (every golden/app settler spawns with an
  explicit non-null job, so no idle settler is ever assigned) — confirm a planner/assignment addition
  only fires on a state the goldens never construct before claiming the hash is untouched. (sim/determinism)
- [94e1b9c] A "walk TO target X" planner drive and the "stay put once ON X" pin must select the SAME
  set of entities, or a settler oscillates: `nearestUnstaffedWorkplaceFor` (the walk drive) first
  guarded only `Building`+`Position`+`recipe`, but `staffsWorkplaceHere` (the pin) queries
  `Building`+`Position`+`Stockpile` — so a producing-but-Stockpile-less workplace would be a walk
  target the pin then refuses to latch, looping walk→not-pinned→harvest→off-tile→walk forever. The
  bug was masked in practice (every `placeBuilding` adds a Stockpile unconditionally), so tests stayed
  green — the thrash only bites a hand-built fixture. When you add a drive that moves an entity to a
  predicate-matched target, make the target predicate IDENTICAL to the predicate that holds it there
  (copy the component query), don't approximate it. (sim/ai)
- [71f13ab] An explicit record component (`JobAssignment{workplace}`) needs a *lifecycle teardown*, not
  just creation: a settler bound to a building keeps a dangling binding to a DEAD entity when the
  building is destroyed — consumers only *defend* against the stale binding (treat-as-no-station), none
  *clear* it, so the worker is neither productive (workplace gone) nor re-employable (still looks
  bound). Put the teardown at the single destruction seam: `demolish` is the *only* `world.destroy`
  call site in the whole sim (no combat/decay path yet), so unbinding there covers every case today —
  and the cleanup belongs in the command handler, not in the generic `world.destroy` (which mustn't
  know about `JobAssignment`). When you add a component that *references another entity*, ask "what
  removes it when the referent dies?" the same iteration you add it. And: collect-then-mutate when a
  `query(A, B)` loop calls `world.remove(e, B)` — removing from the store the query may be iterating is
  a footgun; snapshot the matches first, then mutate. (sim/architecture)
- [3733380] Replacing a derived stand-in (tribe-wide head-count, on-tile presence) with an explicit
  record component (`JobAssignment{workplace}`) makes the new component the single source of truth — but
  the goldens spawn entities (the carpenter) *pre-employed onto their station* that never go through the
  assigning system, so they'd have NO binding and the binding-keyed pin would refuse to hold them →
  behavior change. Fix: have the assigning system *adopt* a pre-employed-but-unbound entity standing on
  a valid target (bind it to the building under its feet), so the record stays authoritative with the
  golden TRACE unchanged — only the hash moves (one new component on one entity), exactly the [20282ef]
  "new state, not a new action" split. And: a brand-new optional component must be added to EVERY test's
  store-clear list ([ac6a287]) — the leak shows up as a sibling test's *logic* failing (a stale binding
  inflates the per-building count), not as an obvious cross-contamination. (sim/architecture)
- [beb6629] Enabling a previously-skipped cross-ref check exposes the synthetic fixtures that exploited
  its absence: the `jobEnablesVehicle 5 7` fixture used an out-of-range marker id (7, no vehicle 7) that
  was harmless while the `vehicle` kind went unchecked, but the IR-integration test (which assembles a
  ContentSet from the *real-shaped* fixtures and asserts it validates) failed the instant the check
  landed — the unit-level order test was green, the assembled-set test was the tripwire. When you turn
  on a validation that was off, grep every fixture for that kind's edges and re-point them to in-range
  ids (the real ones — `jobEnablesVehicle` is `{1..5}`), AND run the real `npm run pipeline` to prove
  the live data resolves (the synthetic fixture proves the *check*; only the real run proves *fidelity*
  — 50 edges across 41 tribes, 0 dangling). The schema namespaces matter: the `vehicle` targetId keys
  into `vehicletypes.type` (the `logicvehicletype` space `{1..6}`), NOT the building space — so an empty
  buildings list can't mask a dangling vehicle edge; an old comment claiming `vehicle`→`BuildingType`
  was simply wrong. (data/extract)
- [f94a65b] Adding a new base `.ini` source to `resolveIniSources` breaks an *unrelated-looking* test:
  one case asserts the resolved source list with an exact `toEqual([...])` (the missing-source-warning
  test), so the new entry fails a sorted-list comparison far from the extractor you wrote. When you
  register a source, grep the pipeline test for `resolveIniSources(` + `toEqual`/`.sort()` and add the
  entry in sorted position. Also: a type table's `id` (a `name` slug) is NOT a unique key — `vehicletypes`
  genuinely ships two `oxcart` records, like `weapontypes`' duplicate `fist`; the cross-ref key is the
  numeric `typeId`, so don't `indexById` a freshly-extracted table without checking the source for dup
  names first. (pipeline/test)
- [08b33ed] `parseContentSet` does NOT default `goods`/`jobs`/`buildings` — they're required (only the
  *other* tables like `vehicles`/`tribes`/`landscape` default to `[]`). A new sim test that builds a
  minimal content set inline (instead of spreading `testContent()`) fails zod validation with `Required`
  on exactly those three, not on the field you were exercising. Either spread the fixture or include the
  three required arrays (even as one-element stubs). (sim/test)
- [5676e8c] An `Invariant` whose check needs CONTENT (here a building type's `homeSize`) doesn't fit the
  `(world) => string[]` signature — but don't widen that signature across every call site / `checkInvariants`.
  Make a **content-bound factory** `populationWithinHousing(content): Invariant` that closes over content
  and returns the plain `Invariant`; a scenario opts in via `invariants: [factory(content)]`, and it stays
  OUT of `CORE_INVARIANTS` (those must run content-free against any world). Same trick a new self-balancing
  system uses to stay inert in the goldens: the births fire only on `home`-kind content the golden/slice
  fixture never builds, so the golden hash + trace are untouched ([6264132]) — verify by grepping the
  fixture for the triggering shape before claiming the hash is stable. (sim/invariants)
- [37ba48a] A standalone smoke script that runs two `Simulation`s in one process sees them DIVERGE
  even on identical state — because `defineComponent` stores are module-level singletons that leak
  entities/ids across runs. The unit tests don't hit this (their `beforeEach` calls `c.store.clear()`).
  When hands-on-verifying determinism outside vitest, clear every component store between runs (the
  golden tests' pattern) before concluding a real non-determinism bug — `git stash` + re-run on `main`
  to check the divergence is in your change, not the harness, ruled it out here. (sim/determinism)
- [dc3ef54] A planner gate that keys on a `jobType`-ID predicate (`isNonWorkingAge`) silently snares an
  unrelated worker when a SYNTHETIC fixture's job id collides with a real data id: the golden slice's
  woodcutter is `jobType 1`, the same number as the real `baby_female` age class, so a new "skip
  non-working ages" check in the AI planner froze the whole golden trace to empty. The fixtures pick
  arbitrary small ids; the age-class ids 1–4 are a *real-data* meaning that doesn't hold in a fixture.
  Fix: gate on a COMPONENT whose presence carries the semantic (`Age` — only a born-young settler has
  one), not on the ambiguous id. When adding a sim rule keyed on a numeric content id that also has a
  reserved/structural meaning, prefer a component/flag the lifecycle maintains over the raw id — and run
  the goldens immediately, an emptied trace is the collision's tell. (sim/ai)
- [cef9629] A `Map`-valued **read view** (a HUD aggregate like `tribeStocks`) may safely iterate a
  `Map`/`Set` non-canonically — the determinism anti-pattern bans non-canonical iteration only for a
  *game decision*, and an aggregate whose VALUES are order-independent (a sum — addition commutes) is
  not one. The returned Map's iteration order is still insertion-order (store-traversal-dependent), so
  document that a display consumer must sort by key itself, and build each per-store sum via the
  canonical `stockpileEntries` to keep the idiom (the values are identical either way). The tell that
  it's a true read view: no system reads it back to branch on it — verify the change leaves the golden
  hash untouched (a read view adds no state). (sim/read-model)
- [4874a0f] When folding a nullable field (`Settler.jobType`) onto a sentinel key, use `?? sentinel`
  (nullish), never `|| sentinel`: a `JobType` id of `0` (`none`) is a VALID id, and `||` would silently
  fold every id-0 settler into the idle bucket. Pick the sentinel OUTSIDE the field's value space — a
  negative (`IDLE_JOB = -1`) for an id space that starts at 0 — so the "unassigned" bucket can never
  collide with a real id. (sim/read-model)
- [c00bf18] A `systems/*` export is NOT on `@vinland/sim`'s top level — `index.ts` re-exports it via
  `export * as systems from './systems/...'`, so the import is `import { systems } from '@vinland/sim';
  systems.goodsGraph`, not a named top-level import. The unit test passed (it imports straight from
  `../src/systems/index.js`), but the 3b hands-on `node -e` against `@vinland/sim` threw `does not
  provide an export named goodsGraph` — the exact "green test, broken at the real entry point" gap the
  hands-on step exists to catch. Mirror the real consumer's import surface in the smoke check. (sim/barrel)
- [faa7885] The render-side HUD must RE-DERIVE its aggregates from the `WorldSnapshot`, NOT call the
  sim's `tribeStocks`/`tribePopulationByJob` read views — those take a live `World`, and `render`
  reading the live stores breaks the pure-consumer rule (the whole point of the snapshot seam). The
  re-derivation is trivial because a count/sum is order-independent (so it matches the sim view by
  construction), but two shape gotchas bite: (a) the snapshot's `clonePlain` turns a component `Map`
  (`Stockpile.amounts`) into a **sorted `[k,v]` array**, so read it as an array, never `.get()`; (b)
  the intermediate aggregation `Map`s are built in entity order, so **explicitly sort the output** by
  id — don't lean on the snapshot's per-entity Map ordering for the cross-entity tallies. A render
  read view mirrors a sim read view's VALUES but lives in `render` and sources the snapshot. (render/hud)
- [d931e4e] An OVERLAY draw (`renderHud`) that `addChild`s a fresh `Container` each frame doesn't leak
  across frames ONLY because the scene draw it follows opens with `app.stage.removeChildren()` — that
  clear wipes the *whole* stage incl. last frame's overlay, so the overlay self-cleans iff it's always
  drawn AFTER `renderScene` (document the ordering). Keep the overlay a separate, independently-callable
  fn that ends in its own `app.render()` (the twin-of-`renderScene` symmetry) and accept the second
  `render()` per frame as the cost of composability — don't fold it into `renderScene`. Match the
  sibling's GPU-resource lifecycle too: `renderScene` never `.destroy()`s its per-frame `Graphics`/
  `Texture`, so a new overlay shouldn't either — destroying-on-remove is a separate render-perf pass over
  BOTH, not a HUD-only divergence. (render/pixi)

- [0708fb4] A read view that returns a `Map` keyed by a "canonical identity" silently DROPS records
  when that identity isn't actually unique — the combat view keyed weapons by the documented
  `(tribeType, typeId)` cross-ref key ([bfe2491]), but the real ANIMAL weapons reuse even that pair
  (tribe 5 = `chicken`+`claw` at typeId 1; tribe 8 = doubled `bearfist`), so the Map collapsed 105
  weapons to 103 last-wins. The unit fixtures (distinct keys) stayed green; only the hands-on real-IR
  `table.size` count (105 vs 103) exposed it. When a read view must lose no records, return an ARRAY
  (one per source entry, source order) and carry the non-unique key as a FIELD, not the Map key — and
  always assert the hands-on output COUNT equals the source count, a keyed-collection size is the tell.
  (sim/read-model)
- [0cbe894] `.ini` key matching in the extractors is CASE-SENSITIVE (`p.key === key`) and the parser
  preserves the source casing verbatim — so an extractor must spell each key with the file's exact
  casing, which is often MIXED within one file (`armortypes.ini`: `type`/`goodtype` lowercase but
  `mainType`/`materialType`/`blockingValue` camelCase). `getInt(sec, 'maintype')` silently returns
  undefined where the file says `mainType`; the field just vanishes (no error), only caught by a
  hands-on pipeline run + asserting the value. `grep -oE '^[a-zA-Z]+' <file> | sort -u` the real keys
  first; match each verbatim (the established convention — see `atomicForHarvesting`). (asset-pipeline)
- [9b41021] A "shared helper leaf" module (the one the cyclic systems import to break import cycles)
  silently becomes a dumping ground: terminal read views (HUD/render projections no per-tick system
  feeds back into a decision) keep getting added there because the barrel re-exports them either way,
  and it doubled in size unnoticed. The leaf's actual membership rule is "imported by ≥1 module in
  SYSTEM_ORDER to break a cycle" — anything only consumed by render/tests is a projection and belongs
  in its own module (`systems/readviews.ts`). Splitting it is a pure import-path move (barrel surface
  unchanged, goldens unchanged); the tell is `grep "from './shared'"` showing the system files never
  import the read views. (sim/structure)
- [4b91238] An `AtomicEffect` keeps the executor a pure state-mutation by carrying the **already-resolved**
  value, not a lookup key: the `attack` effect carries the net `combatDamage` (weapon×armor) the same way
  `pickup`/`eat` carry a resolved `amount`, so `atomicSystem` does the hit with no content/weapon lookup
  of its own (the join happens once, at planning time). A new combatant pool is a **separate optional
  component** (`Health`, like `JobAssignment`/`Age`) so non-combatants/the golden slice carry none and the
  hash is untouched; HP is **whole-integer** (animaltypes.ini scale 200..20000), not a 0..ONE fixed bar,
  so `hitpoints <= 0` death is exact. Clamp damage twice — floor the result at 0 AND floor the incoming
  `damage` at 0 — so a malformed (negative) effect can't silently *heal* the target. (sim/combat)
- [e2f3a83] The dangling-reference hazard a `world.destroy` creates depends on which DIRECTION the
  cross-reference points: destroying a *settler* (the new combat death path, the SECOND destroy site
  after `demolish`) is clean because the settler HOLDS its refs (`JobAssignment` points
  settler→building) — they vanish with it; the [71f13ab] hazard was the REVERSE (a *building*
  destroyed under a worker that still points AT it), handled at the `demolish` seam. So when you add a
  destroy site, audit only the refs that point *to* the destroyed entity, not the ones it holds; here
  no component points building→settler, so the new path needs no teardown. And a system that
  `world.destroy`s while scanning a store must collect-then-destroy (gather matches into a list first,
  mutate after) — and sort that list canonically when its side effects are observed (the emitted
  `settlerDied` events render reads), even though events aren't in `hashState`. (sim/combat)
- [8addb28] A per-entity planner pass (combatSystem giving each idle combatant a target) can iterate
  the non-canonical `world.query(...)` (smallest-store insertion order) and STAY deterministic — but
  only because each decision is **order-invariant**: an attacker's target eligibility (`Health > 0`,
  different tribe, in range) never depends on whether another attacker already acted this pass, and the
  *target pick itself* uses canonical `canonicalEntities()` + an id tie-break. The rule isn't "always
  sort the driver"; it's "the OUTCOME must not depend on visit order" — adding a `CurrentAtomic` to A
  doesn't change whether A is a valid target for B, so the set of (attacker→target) decisions is the
  same regardless of order (same stance as aiSystem's `query(Settler, Position)`). The determinism test
  (two same-seed runs hash-equal) is what proves it, not the iteration choice. (sim/determinism)
- [8addb28] `sim.events` are cleared each tick, so a test that runs many `step()`s and then reads
  `sim.snapshot().events` only sees the LAST tick's events — a one-shot event (a kill's `settlerDied`)
  fired mid-loop is gone. Accumulate across the loop (`deaths += ...events.filter(...)` per step) to
  assert it, or the check silently degrades to a no-op (the `>= 0` trap). (sim/testing)
- [a4595ae] The "N data-defined tribes, never hardcode two" rule is satisfiable WITHOUT new code in the
  mechanics: the pipeline already extracts all 41 `[tribetype]`s and every sim rule resolves per-tribe
  off `settler.tribe → content.tribes.find(...)`, so the sim is tribe-agnostic by construction. The only
  thing missing was *classifying* which tribes are controllable — and the source distinguishes a
  civilization from an animal **by the data alone**: only a civilization carries `jobEnables` tech-graph
  edges (`jobEnables.length === 0` ⇔ animal, 0 mismatches against `jobRequirements` over the real IR).
  So the scaffolding is a pure read view filtering on that signature, not a hardcoded name/count. When a
  roadmap item says "data-defined X, never hardcode the count", first check whether the data already
  carries a *distinguishing field* — the classification is usually a read view, not a mechanic. And a
  read view that `.filter(...).sort(...)` is determinism-safe because `filter` allocates a fresh array,
  so the in-place `.sort()` never mutates the shared `content`. (sim/read-model)
- [fe7ac0e] A negative predicate over partial data has THREE truth states, not two: `isAnimalTribe`
  is NOT `!isPlayableTribe`. A tribe can be a known civilization (recorded, has tech graph), a known
  animal (recorded, empty tech graph), OR unknown (no record at all). `!isPlayableTribe` lumps the
  unknown case in with animals — wrong, because a no-record different-tribe combatant (a synthetic
  enemy) must stay a valid PvP enemy, not get silently reclassified as wildlife. When you split a set
  by a data signature, define each side as a POSITIVE membership test (`record exists && signature`),
  so the absent-record case falls through both rather than defaulting into one. (sim/data-classification)
- [838b1fa] Not every IR type table keys on `type` — `animaltypes.ini` keys on `tribetype` (an
  animal's identity IS its owning tribe; the source carries no `type`), and a couple of real records
  carry NO `tribetype` at all (disabled stubs). So this extractor DROPS-on-missing-key rather than
  `requireTypeId`-THROWS: the throw stance is right when the key's absence is malformed, but wrong when
  the key is legitimately absent in shipped data. Check the real file's key field + look for records
  missing it before assuming the `requireTypeId(...,'type')` template; the cross-ref then validates the
  chosen key (here `tribeType` → the tribe table). (pipeline/extractor)
- [4566b16] A "single source of truth" relation must gate BOTH sides itself, not lean on its one caller.
  `mayAttack(attacker,target)` first encoded only the target rules and let the combat loop skip a passive
  animal attacker — so `mayAttack(passiveAnimal, civ)` wrongly returned true; correct in-system (the loop
  guards), but a latent trap the moment a second caller uses the relation directly. Fix: fold the attacker
  gate into the relation; the loop's matching skip becomes a fast-path, not the authority. A relation
  documented as authoritative must be self-contained. (sim/combat)
- [8579a56] The committed local `content/ir.json` can be STALE relative to the extractors: it had
  `animals: 0` (predating the animaltypes extractor), so a hands-on check that read it would have
  "passed" against zero real records — a false green. For a read view over extracted data, exercise
  it against a FRESHLY re-run pipeline (`npm run pipeline … --out <scratch>`), not the checked-in IR,
  or the 3b smoke check verifies nothing. (pipeline/hands-on)
- [9ce6413] A deterministic entity-scatter that CLAMPS each member's offset to a max radius silently
  re-uses tiles once the rings past that radius repeat (clamp(ring, range) collapses ring 3+ onto the
  range-2 ring) — two entities stack. It's only safe here because the sim has **no position-uniqueness
  invariant** (entities share tiles freely) and real `animaltypes` `maximumgroupsize` (3..6) stays under
  the 9-tile first-ring bound; assert the no-stacking property only for the sizes you actually spawn,
  and document the collision bound rather than implying a packing guarantee. (sim/spawn)
- [8617f44] A combat fixture gave its ANIMAL combatants a `jobType` so they'd resolve a weapon — but
  the real spawner (`spawnAnimalHerd`) places animals jobless (`jobType: null`), and the weapon lookup
  keyed on `(tribe, job)`, so every *actually-spawned* aggressive animal silently did **zero** damage
  while every unit test passed. When a producer (a spawn command) and a consumer (a weapon resolver)
  disagree on a key field's shape, a fixture that pre-fills the field hides the gap; test the consumer
  with the *exact* shape the producer emits (here: a jobless animal), and exercise the full `step()`
  schedule end-to-end, not the system in isolation. (sim/combat)
- [bec7cfc] A numeric tuning option threaded into a modulo/comparison loop (`chosen % stride`, `len >=
  maxHerds`) silently MIS-behaves on a non-finite value: `Math.max(1, Math.floor(NaN))` is `NaN`, and
  every comparison with `NaN` is false — so `% NaN === 0` never picks (empty result) and `>= NaN` never
  caps (uncapped result), both failing QUIETLY rather than throwing. The TS `number` type doesn't forbid
  `NaN`, so a public API that loops on an option should `Number.isFinite(opt) ? clamp : default` (fall
  back to the documented default), not just `?? default` (which only catches `undefined`). Guard the
  option where it enters the loop, not at the call site. (sim/api)
- [bec7cfc] A "map populator that seeds wildlife" is faithfully a PURE command-PRODUCER, not a system:
  `seedAnimalHerds(content, terrain)` returns the `spawnAnimalHerd` commands a caller enqueues through
  the one mutation seam — so it touches no entity store (trivially deterministic/replay-faithful, inert
  on goldens because nothing calls it there) and stays out of `SYSTEM_ORDER` (seeding is a one-shot at
  map load, not per-tick). When a roadmap step is "issue command X to populate the world", prefer a pure
  function returning `Command[]` over a new tick system; the command seam already gives you logging,
  replay, and determinism for free. (sim/architecture)
- [1f8f2c9] Adding one field (`leaderDistance`) to a derived-view struct (`HerdParams`) broke three
  `toEqual` assertions that snapshot the whole object — `toEqual` is exhaustive, so a grown read view
  ripples into every test that pins its full shape. That is the *intended* tripwire (a view's shape is
  part of its contract), but budget for it: when you widen a struct, grep its `toEqual(` call sites and
  give the new field a *meaningful* fixture value (not the schema default) so the assertion still proves
  something. (sim/readviews)
- [3f064cd] A "stamp a timer component, reap it on read" pattern (`Anger`, reaped by `hostileAnimalNow`)
  leaks stale state if the reaper SHORT-CIRCUITS before reading it: an aggressive+`getAngry` animal
  returns hostile on the `isAggressiveAnimal` check and never reaches the `Anger`-expiry branch, so a
  redundant stamp would never be reaped. Fix at the STAMP site (don't stamp when the entity is already
  unconditionally in the state the timer grants), not only the reaper. Inert components must still be
  hash-clean — a never-reaped optional component would drift the state hash. (sim/combat)
- [3f9b610] The synthetic fixture's tidy weapon ranges (`maxRange 2`, adjacent fighters) hide that REAL
  weapons carry a `minRange` (the real `hunter_bow` is `minRange 3, maxRange 17`) — and `attackerWeapon`
  enforces only `maxRange`, so a fixture-adjacent strike "passes" while a real bow can't hit a tile-1 prey
  in the original. A green unit test on the fixture didn't reveal this; only running the actual pipeline IR
  through `step()` did (the deer fixture struck fine at distance 1; the real cow only after seeing the
  `minRange`). When a mechanic reads a numeric range/threshold param, check the REAL data's spread, not the
  fixture's convenient value — and note any param the sim doesn't yet honor. (sim/combat)
- [469e2c8] Adding a `minRange` floor (`dist < minRange` rejects a candidate) silently changes the
  *same-cell* (Manhattan distance 0) case the old `maxRange`-only check let through: with `minRange`
  floored at 1, a co-located target is now "too close" and unhittable. It's the faithful reading of
  `minimumrange 1` ("at least one cell away"), but it's a real behavior shift reachable whenever entities
  stack (the herd scatter can — there's no position-uniqueness invariant, [9ce6413]). When you add a
  near-bound to a reach/threshold that was previously open at 0, name the dist-0 consequence in the doc
  and confirm no test/golden places two combatants on one tile — the change is invisible until they do.
  (sim/combat)
- [4d44dec] The `combatSystem` targeting drive silently does NOTHING unless TWO preconditions hold that
  the `atomicSystem` unit tests bypass: (a) `ctx.terrain` is defined — a **mapless** `Simulation` (no
  `opts.map`) returns immediately, so no target is ever picked; (b) the **attacker** carries a `Health`
  pool — the combatant scan is `world.query(Settler, Health, Position)`, so a `Health`-less hunter is
  never even scanned. The attack-effect unit tests `startAtomic` the `attack` directly and so prove the
  hit/yield without ever exercising targeting — a full-`step()` hands-on harness that omits a map or the
  attacker's `Health` sees the prey sit untouched forever (looks like a broken feature; it's a missing
  precondition). When hands-on-verifying a combat/targeting change end-to-end, build the sim WITH a
  walkable map (and a real-content map needs a real walkable landscape typeId — typeId 0 is absent from
  the real IR, use one that exists) and give every intended combatant a `Health` pool. (sim/combat)
- [c8e6639] An ad-hoc hands-on determinism check (run the scenario twice, compare `hashState()`)
  FALSE-FAILED — reported `hash-equal: false` for a change that was perfectly deterministic — because
  the two runs shared the **module-singleton component stores** (`Position.store` etc. are global
  across `Simulation` instances) and the second run inherited the first's leftover entities. The
  vitest suites avoid this with a `beforeEach` `clearStores()`; a throwaway harness that loops two
  runs in one function does NOT get that, so it must `Foo.store.clear()` for every touched component
  between runs (or the hash diverges from stale state, not from real nondeterminism). Don't trust a
  bare two-run hash compare until the stores are cleared between them. (sim/test/determinism)
- [bfa4a13] A hands-on number can COINCIDE across the old and new code path and silently fail to prove
  the new branch ran: armor mitigation resolved a leather-clad hit to `damage["1"] 60 − blockingValue
  10 = 50`, the *same* number as the old unarmored `damage["0"] 50`, so "first attack damage = 50" was
  identical with and without the armored path. What actually proved the new path executed was the
  **state hash differing** between the two runs (the `Armor` component live in the hash). When verifying
  a new code path, pick fixture values whose output DIFFERS — or lean on `hashState()`, not a scalar that
  can collide. (sim/combat)
- [d7eb755] A fidelity comment's "count" of a repeated `.ini` key (`logicgood`) is the *line count*, not
  the highest enumerated id — I eyeballed `54` from the max good id (55) when the actual `logicgood` line
  count is `49`. When a doc states "N ids", derive N from the hands-on output (`cargoGoods.length`) or an
  `awk` line count, never from the value range. (pipeline/fidelity)
- [8fb6543] A new entity that carries `Stockpile`+`Position` (the boat `Vehicle` hull) is ALREADY a
  deposit sink the instant it exists — `nearestStoreFor`/`pileup` scan `Stockpile`+`Position`, not
  `Building`, and `stockCapacity` returned `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` for it (the "no Building ⇒ bare fixture,
  uncapped" branch). So `placeBoat` had silently made a hull an UNCAPPED catch-all store accepting any
  good; the cargo-load step is really *restricting* an over-permissive default (gate by `cargoGoods` +
  `stockSlots`), not adding a brand-new path. When you add an entity with a component that a generic
  scan keys on, check what the existing helpers already do with it BEFORE writing the "new" behavior —
  the default may already be wrong, not absent. (sim/ai)
- [9433030] A `{@link Foo}` in a new file's JSDoc only resolves if `Foo` is defined or imported IN that
  file — a cross-module link to a sibling read-view symbol (`{@link shipVehicles}` from `jobs.ts`) is
  DANGLING even though `check`/`build` stay green (biome/tsc don't validate tsdoc link targets, so it
  passes silently and only a reviewer catches it — the exact de39b3d finding, recurring). When you
  copy a doc block from a sibling module as a template, downgrade any `{@link X}` whose `X` you didn't
  also import to plain `` `X` `` backticks. (docs)
- [796fcb2] A roadmap "bring over the mod's data edits" item can imply an overlay-MERGE that doesn't
  exist: the previous step's hint was to diff which `DataCnmd` `.ini` rows override the base
  `Data/logic` type tables — but the mod ships ZERO copies of `goodtypes`/`jobtypes`/`landscapetypes`/
  `vehicletypes`/`armortypes`/`animaltypes`.ini (`find DataCnmd -iname '<t>.ini'` is empty), so there
  is no logic-table merge to do; each rule table already has a single readable source. The mod's actual
  readable contribution is graphics/tribe/house/weapon/atomic `.ini`s, most already preferred. The real
  unbuilt overlay was a GRAPHICS one (mod `types/vehiclestype/jobgraphics.ini` twin of the base
  `vehicles/jobgraphics.cif`, broader per-tribe). Before scoping a "mod overlays base table X" merge,
  `find` the mod tree for X's filename first — a [4ef956f]-family non-existent-source trap. (pipeline/roadmap)

- [3215de3] A "graphics" file can carry BALANCE data — don't trust a source-blocked claim by filename.
  The roadmap deferred house build/upgrade costs as "below the `.ini`", reading only `types/houses.ini`
  (the `[logichousetype]` logic table, which indeed has no cost key). But its graphics twin
  `budynki12/houses/houses.ini` (`[GfxHouse]`) carries `LogicConstructionGoods` — the per-level
  build-material cost — among the render keys. Before recording a datum as oracle-blocked, grep the
  OTHER readable file for the same `Logic*` prefix; the engine splits one entity's logic across a
  "logic" and a "graphics" `.ini`, and a `Logic*` key can live in the graphics one. Same-typeId rows
  recur per `LogicTribeType` AND per `sizeIdx` with different costs, so a flat-by-typeId overlay must
  pick a deterministic winner (lowest tribe, lowest size) and record the collapse in FIDELITY. (pipeline/fidelity)
- [e4d77a8] The sim's `EventBuffer` exposes `current()`/`clear()`, NOT a `drain()` — and it's only
  cleared at tick start by `step()`. When unit-testing a system by calling it DIRECTLY (not via
  `step()`), the buffer is never cleared, so read its emitted events with `current()`; reaching for
  `drain()` (a different bus's API) won't compile. (sim/testing)
- [f4593c4] A `step()`-based test that PASSES in isolation but FAILS in its file is the [ac6a287]
  store-leak: a partial `beforeEach` clear (only the components the test names) leaks an earlier
  test's entity through a store it DIDN'T clear (a stale `CurrentAtomic`/`Production`/`Health` on a
  reused id), and because entity ids are fresh-per-`Simulation` but the stores are global singletons,
  the leaked component lands on this test's entity and silently diverts a planner decision (here a
  carrier never moved). `hashState()` won't flag it (a `-t` single-test run hashes fine). Fix: clear
  the WHOLE component namespace, not a hand-picked subset — `for (const c of Object.values(components))
  if (c?.store instanceof Map) c.store.clear()` — so a future component added by an unrelated system in
  the schedule can't leak in. The tell is "green alone, red in-suite". (sim/test)
- [3950dc3] An in-place mutation inside a `world.query` loop (a home upgrade flipping `Building.buildingType`)
  is safe to NOT re-process the same tick — but for the right reason: `world.query` is a **lazy generator**
  iterating `smallest.store.keys()` live, NOT a snapshot, so the "at most once" guarantee comes from each
  entity id being *yielded once* and the upgrade keeping the same store key (mutate the value, add/remove no
  entity), not from any snapshotting. Don't write "the matches are snapshotted" in a determinism rationale —
  it's wrong and a future maintainer who *adds* an entity mid-loop (which CAN perturb a live `Map`-keys
  iteration) would trust a false premise. State the real invariant: same key, yielded once. (sim/determinism)
- [0a6d0fc] A guard that holds only as an *incidental* side effect of one subsystem's data model is a
  latent bug the moment a second input dimension overlaps: `productionSystem` "didn't" run on an
  under-construction site only because a construction site's `stockCapacity` advertised its build
  materials, so a recipe OUTPUT not in the cost got room 0 → cycle never started. But the INPUT side
  of `canStartCycle` reads the raw stockpile, never `stockCapacity`, so a recipe whose input overlapped
  a delivered build material WOULD have been raided — and production runs before construction in
  `SYSTEM_ORDER`. A doc even *claimed* "production already gates on built" when it didn't. When a
  desired invariant ("unbuilt ⇒ no production") is true only by emergent coincidence of another
  system's capacity arithmetic, make it an explicit gate (`built < ONE → continue`); the coincidence
  breaks the instant the two goods sets intersect. Grep the other iterators of the same component pair
  for the same gap (housing/reproduction already gated; `tribeStocks` deliberately doesn't). (sim/production)
- [15cdcb6] `stockCapacity` is a SOFT carrier-scan advertising ceiling, not a hard cap any invariant
  enforces (`stockNonNegative` only bounds [0, 2^31)). So to make a store pull in EXTRA goods (a built
  home accumulating its next-tier upgrade cost), just RAISE its advertised capacity — `Math.max(slotCap,
  upgradeAmount)` — and the existing `nearestStoreFor`→`pileup` path delivers them; no new transport
  code, and transiently holding more than the nominal slot cap trips nothing (no "stock ≤ slotCap"
  invariant exists). Before raising a capacity to drive delivery, confirm no invariant treats it as a
  hard bound; here none does, so the seam composes for free. (sim/transport)
