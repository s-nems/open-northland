# Sources & format reference

This project reads two sibling folders (read-only) at `~/Projects/vikings/`:

- `Cultures 8th Wonder/` — the original game **+ the `culturesnation` mod** (`DataCnmd/`). The
  *input* to the asset pipeline. Copyrighted; never copied into this repo.
- `OpenVikings_reversing/` — a C#/.NET binary-faithful reverse engineering. **Our format manual.**

## Original file formats (what the pipeline must decode)

Counts observed in `Cultures 8th Wonder` (base `Data` + `DataX` + mod `DataCnmd`):

| Ext | ~Count | What it is | Decode reference in OpenVikings (`Source/`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.wav` | 752 | sound effects | — (use as-is / transcode to ogg) |
| `.pcx` | 426 | palette-indexed pictures | `NXBasics/CPicture.cs`, `NXBasics/XBPictureTool.cs` |
| `.bmd` | 247 | "bob" framed sprite animations | `NXBasics/CBobManager.cs` (3.8k lines), `NXBasics/CBitmap.cs` |
| `.hlt` | 242 | lighting / remap tables | `NXBasics/CRemapTable.cs`, `CHighColorCreator.cs`, `CTrueColorCreator.cs` |
| `.cif` | 167 | compiled/encrypted "Cultures Information File" (rules) | `NC2Logic/CIoHelper.cs`, `SystemHandles/InitGameHandler.cs` |
| `.ini` | 66 | **readable** rule config | trivial text parse; prefer these |
| `.sgt`/`.dls` | 49+ | **DirectMusic** segments/instruments — Windows-only | transcode offline to ogg; do not depend on DirectMusic |
| `.fnt` | 63 | bitmap fonts | `NXBasics/CFont.cs` |
| `.lib` | — | packed archive (group + files + checksum) | `NXBasics/CSimpleFileLibrary.cs` |
| file IO base | — | low-level readers, endian | `NXBasics/CFile.cs`, `Dexter/DexterFile.cs`, `Dexter/DexterEndian.cs` |
| palettes | — | palette objects | `NXBasics/CPalette.cs` |

### Key facts learned from inspection

- **`.cif` is compiled/encrypted.** Header begins `fd 03 00 00 ...` followed by high-entropy bytes;
  there is a checksum/hash scheme (`Dexter/DexMD5.cs`). Decoding it is a research task — but often
  unnecessary: **the `culturesnation` mod ships readable `.ini` equivalents** under
  `DataCnmd/types/` (e.g. `houses.ini`, `weapons.ini`, `humanstype/…`) for rules the base game only
  has as `.cif`. The pipeline should prefer `.ini` and only tackle `.cif` for data with no `.ini`.
- **Rules are largely declarative.** `Data/logic/` and `DataCnmd/types/` define buildings, jobs,
  goods, weapons, animals, vehicles, tribes, landscape patterns as key/value blocks — see examples
  in `docs/DATA-FORMAT.md`. This is why the *rules* port is tractable; the *behavior* (settler AI,
  economy, pathfinding) is the hard part and is **not** in the data nor reversed in OpenVikings.
- **Mod content** (`DataCnmd`) is data + new campaigns (`OsmyCudSwiata` = 8th Wonder,
  `WyprawaNaPolnoc` = expedition north, `BramyAsgardu` = gates of Asgard) + ~125 maps in
  `CnModMaps/`. It is portable to a new engine as content, not as binary patches.
- **OpenVikings status (as of its Feb 2026 commits):** boots an SDL window, decodes graphics,
  loads archives, renders intro — but the **game simulation is not implemented** (its logic tick
  dispatcher just increments a counter). So it helps us with *formats*, not with *mechanics*.

## How to use OpenVikings as reference

When writing a pipeline decoder, open the matching C# file above and translate the **format
reading logic** (byte layout, decompression, palette application) into TypeScript in
`tools/asset-pipeline/src/decoders/`. Port the *format*, not the engine architecture. Record the
source file + commit you referenced in the decoder's header comment for traceability.

## Legal line

We ship code only. No assets, no decoded content, no original binaries are committed. Users run the
pipeline against their own copy. GPLv3-compatible intent, mirroring OpenVikings' stance.
