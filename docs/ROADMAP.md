# Roadmap

Phased plan. Each phase ends with something runnable or testable. The **current target** is the
top unchecked milestone. Do the smallest next step toward it; don't build ahead.

> This roadmap was revised after a design review against the actual game data. Key corrections:
> `.cif` decoding is on the critical path (not deferrable); settler behavior is an **atomic-action
> planner** (not bespoke per-job code); a **progression/tech graph** is a first-class system;
> navigation is a **cell graph** (the triangle grid is a *render* concern); there are **N tribes**,
> not two. See docs/SOURCES.md and docs/ECS.md.

## Phase 0 — Foundation  ✅ (this scaffold)
- [x] Monorepo, packages, docs, conventions, determinism rules.
- [x] Deterministic ECS, scaled-integer fixed-point (no BigInt/overflow), seeded RNG, canonical
      full-state hash, invariants + headless scenario harness, synthetic test fixture.
- [x] Modern type vocabulary: **branded** `Fixed`/`Entity`, **discriminated-union** commands /
      atomic-effects / events + `assertNever`, typed per-tick event buffer (render/audio seam).
- [x] DX guardrails: **Biome** (format+lint), **CI** (check+typecheck+test), and a determinism
      source-hygiene test that fails if a nondeterministic global enters `sim`.
- [x] `npm install` + `npm run build` + `npm test` + `npm run check` green.

## Phase 1 — Asset pipeline + `.cif` (de-risk formats first)
Goal: turn an owned game copy into the IR. This removes the biggest technical unknowns. **`.cif`
is here, not later** — core types (`housetypes`, `weapontypes`, `trianglepatterntypes`,
`atomicanimations`) and **all maps** are `.cif`-only.
- [ ] **`.cif` decrypt + container parse.** Port `XB_Decrypt_Memory` from OpenVikings
      `NXBasics/XBTools.cs` (the `(in-1)^key` scheme, ~40 lines). *Decryption is solved;* the real
      unknown is the **decrypted payload/record layout** — spike `housetypes.cif` and `map.cif`
      first and write down the structure.
- [ ] `.lib` archive unpacker (ref `CSimpleFileLibrary.cs`).
- [ ] Palette + `.pcx` decoder → PNG (ref `CPalette.cs`, `CPicture.cs`). **Validate against the
      OpenVikings oracle** (it renders the originals) pixel-for-pixel.
- [ ] `.ini` rule parser → typed IR (note base `Data/logic/*.ini` is the primary readable source;
      handle the `<CULTURES_CIF_BEGIN>` header line; decode text as **CP1250**, not UTF-8).
- [ ] **Atomic vocabulary extraction** (free, from readable data): `tribetypes.ini` `setatomic`
      (atomic→animation per tribe), `jobtypes.ini` `allowatomic`, `goodtypes.ini` `atomicFor*`.
- [ ] `.bmd` bob decoder → atlas PNG + anim JSON (ref `CBobManager.cs`, `CBitmap.cs`). **Hardest.**
- [ ] One map (`map.cif` + its `.ini`/`.inc` parts) decoded to IR.
- **Exit:** `npm run pipeline` produces a validated `content/` (types + atlases + one map), decoded
  graphics verified against the oracle.

## Phase 2 — Vertical slice (prove the sim)  ← **first real target**
Goal: one tribe, headless-correct, then on screen. Establish the invariants that the rest depends on.
- [ ] **CommandSystem + serializable command schema** — the ONLY way state mutates. Save = command
      log from day one (disk format later; the invariant is now). Define the **snapshot read-view**
      (double-buffer or immutable view) so `render` never reads mid-mutation.
- [ ] Terrain as a **cell-adjacency graph** with per-type walk cost/valency (from
      `landscapetypes.ini`). *Not* the triangle geometry — that's render-only.
- [ ] PathfindingSystem: A* on the cell graph with **canonical tie-breaking** (budgeted/tick).
- [ ] MovementSystem (fixed-point) following paths.
- [ ] **Atomic planner slice:** AISystem picks an atomic (utility over the job's allowed atomics);
      AtomicSystem executes it to completion and applies its effect. One settler: harvest wood →
      pickup → carry → pileup at store.
- [ ] One workplace: ProductionSystem consumes input → output, **enforcing per-good stock capacity**.
- [ ] A minimal **carrier** moving goods between store and workplace (goods never teleport).
- [ ] Render: isometric terrain + the settler sprite from the atlas, **depth-sorted by feet anchor**
      (a visual checklist item — can't be golden-hashed; see docs/TESTING.md).
- [ ] Golden state-hash + golden **atomic-action trace** over ~1000 ticks; invariants each tick.
- **Exit:** click to place one workplace; a settler autonomously supplies it via atomics; carrier
  hauls output; deterministic, invariant-clean, replay-equal.

## Phase 3 — Economy, progression & population
- [ ] Full **goods graph** as an explicit IR artifact (extract from `goodtypes.productionInputGoods`):
      raw → flour/plank/tool → bread/weapons, two food tiers (`food_simple`/`food_extra`).
- [ ] NeedsSystem: hunger + non-food needs implied by atomics (eat, plus deferred-but-named
      `pray`/`enjoy`/social/`make_love`).
- [ ] **ProgressionSystem** — experience + tech graph: `humanjobexperiencetypes` per-specialization
      XP, `trainforjob` schooling, `needfor*`/`allow*`/`jobEnables*` gating goods/houses/jobs/vehicles.
- [ ] JobSystem assignment across many workplaces; multiple carriers + vehicle stock slots.
- [ ] ConstructionSystem: place → deliver materials → build; **house leveling** (`home level 00..04`)
      → population capacity → the births→housing→births loop.
- [ ] ReproductionSystem: families, children growing up, gated by housing.
- [ ] HUD: stocks, population, jobs, the goods graph.
- **Exit:** a self-sustaining, progressing single-tribe settlement you can grow.

## Phase 4 — Conflict & content breadth (N tribes)
- [ ] CombatSystem from `weapontypes`/`armortypes` (a large subsystem: many soldier classes, armor
      tiers, named heroes, amulets/potions — scope it honestly).
- [ ] **N data-defined tribes** (viking/frank/saracen/byzantine/egypt), asymmetry expressed through
      each tribe's atomic bindings + `allow*`/`needfor*` graph — never hardcode "two".
- [ ] **Animals as non-controllable tribes** (`animaltypes.ini`: aggression, groups, hitpoints) —
      same entity/AI model, not a separate bolt-on.
- [ ] **Sea/Northland identity:** water valency, boats as mobile stores, embark/disembark atomics,
      `fisher_sea`/`trader_sea`/`carpenter ship`, `vehicle_ship`.
- [ ] Import full base + `culturesnation` content; bring over the mod's balance edits (data).
- **Exit:** N tribes can coexist/fight; sea travel works; most content types represented.

## Phase 5 — Campaigns, polish, platform
- [ ] Campaign/scripting layer (decide early: data-driven triggers preferred over code) — load
      `OsmyCudSwiata` / `WyprawaNaPolnoc` / `BramyAsgardu`. **Verify whether mod campaigns carry
      scripted behavior** a data-only pipeline would miss.
- [ ] Save/load: command-log replay + **snapshot fast-load** (replay-all is unviable for hours-long
      settlements). Snapshot schema designed alongside components in Phase 2, finalized here.
- [ ] Audio (transcoded ogg; no DirectMusic `.sgt`/`.dls` dependency).
- [ ] Tauri desktop builds for Mac/Win/Linux (renderer stays WebView-compatible).
- [ ] (Stretch) lockstep multiplayer — the determinism work pays off here.

## Cross-cutting DX (modern wins — the deterministic core makes these cheap)
- [ ] **Run the sim in a Web Worker.** It's pure/headless/deterministic, so moving `step()` off the
      main thread keeps render at 60fps under heavy ticks. Design the Phase-2 snapshot as a plain
      **transferable** structure (no class instances / live `Map`s) so this is free later, not a retrofit.
- [ ] **Time-travel / replay inspector.** With `rng.getState/setState`, the command log, and
      `hashState`, a dev overlay can scrub ticks, diff state between two ticks, and dump an entity.
      "Hash diverged at tick 432" → jump there → inspect. Biggest debuggability multiplier for agents.
- [ ] **Content hot-reload.** Content is validated JSON injected into the sim; wire Vite HMR to
      re-parse and rebase the sim on file change → instant balance-tweak feedback, no rebuild.

## Risks & open unknowns (watch these)
- **`.cif` decrypted payload structure** — decryption solved; the *record layout* of
  `housetypes`/`map.cif`/`atomicanimations` is the genuine unknown. De-risk first in Phase 1.
- **Settler AI fidelity** — the soul, undocumented. Approach = planner over the data-extracted
  atomic vocabulary; calibrate atomic timings/yields (in `atomicanimations.cif`) by observation,
  kept as data so tuning is a diff. See docs/ECS.md "Settler AI".
- **Atomic timings/effects** live in encrypted `atomicanimations.cif` — vocabulary is free, timing
  is reverse-engineered/tuned.
- **Combat & campaign scripting scope** — both larger than one roadmap line implies.
- **Determinism drift** — every new system must keep golden state + trace tests green.
